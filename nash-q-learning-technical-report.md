## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Algorithmic Architecture

#### 2.1.1 Environment Modeling

The proposed framework introduces a sophisticated grid environment with multidimensional complexity:

```python
class Grid:
    def __init__(self,
                 length=2, 
                 width=2, 
                 players=[Player(), Player()],
                 reward_coordinates=[1,1],
                 reward_value=20,
                 obstacle_coordinates=[],
                 collision_allowed=False,
                 collision_penalty=0):
        # Environment configuration parameters
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
        self.players = players
        self.reward_coordinates = reward_coordinates
        self.reward_value = reward_value
        # ... additional configuration
```

Key Environmental Components:
- Dynamic grid dimensions
- Configurable player characteristics
- Reward and obstacle placement
- Collision management strategies

#### 2.1.2 Learning Mechanism

The Nash Q-Learning algorithm implements a sophisticated learning process:

1. **State Space Exploration**
   - Comprehensive joint state generation
   - Transition probability computation
   - Nash equilibrium identification

2. **Q-Value Update Mechanism**
   ```python
   def update_q_values(current_state, action_pair, next_state):
       # Nash equilibrium-based Q-value update
       Q_value = (1 - learning_rate) * current_q_value + 
                  learning_rate * (immediate_reward + 
                  discount_factor * equilibrium_value)
   ```

3. **Action Selection Strategies**
   - Random exploration
   - Greedy selection
   - ε-greedy probabilistic approach

### 2.2 Computational Complexity Analysis

#### Theoretical Complexity
- State Space: O(n²), where n represents grid dimensions
- Equilibrium Computation: O(m³), m being movement actions
- Learning Iteration Complexity: O(k * n²), k being iterations

### 2.3 Experimental Configuration

#### Hyperparameter Specification
| Parameter           | Value   | Rationale |
|---------------------|---------|-----------|
| Learning Rate       | 0.5     | Moderate information absorption |
| Discount Factor     | 0.7     | Significant future reward consideration |
| Max Iterations      | 100     | Sufficient convergence exploration |
| Exploration Rate (ε)| 0.5     | Balanced exploration-exploitation |

### 2.4 Equilibrium Computation

The implementation leverages the `nashpy` library for sophisticated equilibrium detection:

```python
def compute_nash_equilibrium(q_tables):
    game = nash.Game(q_tables[0], q_tables[1])
    equilibria = list(game.support_enumeration())
    # Select equilibrium based on multi-criteria optimization
```

### 3.2 Experimental Insights
